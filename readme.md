# 🧪 Jin — JSON Inspector

**Jin** _(short for JSON Inspector)_ is a lightweight, browser-based JSON API viewer — designed to be the **simplest way** to inspect, debug, and beautify JSON responses from any public API. Think of it as your minimal, no-install version of Postman, just focused on clean JSON visualization.
